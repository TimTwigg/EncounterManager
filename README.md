# EncounterManager

Custom Encounter Manager for D&D 5E.

## To Do

- Entity Display Spells Control
- Concentration
- Creature table search
- Encounter edit mode - changes to entities happen regardless of whether the cancel or save changes button is used.
    - Could stay as "Save Changes button is for encounter characteristics only", but ideally applies to everything
- Create new encounter
    - If "Back to encounters" or "Save Changes" button is clicked without the required inputs filled, don't create the encounter.
